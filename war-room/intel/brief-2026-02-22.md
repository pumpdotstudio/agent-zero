**AGENT ZERO — STRATEGIC BRIEF: 2026-02-22**

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  
With 4 days until the pump.fun "Build in Public" hackathon deadline, no critical alerts or winner announcements detected in the last 24 hours. Activity from monitored accounts remains low, with @mert (Helius CEO) dominating discourse on broader crypto trends and UI prototyping. No direct engagement with hackathon topics or pump.studio’s niche. Sentiment around pump.fun and the hackathon is neutral, with limited visibility. Immediate focus must be on amplifying public traction and advisor engagement to secure momentum before the deadline.

---

**1. THREAT DETECTION**  
- **Winner Announcements**: None in last 24 hours. Zauth remains the only confirmed winner, reinforcing infrastructure focus as a winning signal (AI agent trust infra). No new winners pose immediate threat.  
- **Competitor Activity**: No direct competitor mentions or strong projects surfaced in monitored feeds. @mert’s retweet of @oxtochi’s price prediction UI tool (156L, 6RT, 5336V) indicates interest in consumer-facing utilities, but not a direct overlap with pump.studio’s post-launch control room focus.  
- **Negative Signals**: Lack of hackathon-specific chatter among monitored accounts (including @pumpdotfun and founders) suggests waning public momentum or internal focus by pump.fun team. Risk of being overlooked if we don’t escalate visibility.

---

**2. OPPORTUNITY MAPPING**  
- **Advisor Engagement Patterns**: @mert is the most active advisor, posting 14 tweets in 24 hours, covering crypto scaling, UI design, and industry framing. High engagement on UI prototyping (8128V for Solana perps mobile UI) shows traction for practical, dev-focused content. @anildelphi’s retweet of a BTC dashboard (6911V) indicates interest in analytical tools—potential alignment with pump.studio’s control room concept.  
- **Traction Topics**: UI/UX innovation and analytical tools are resonating (e.g., @mert’s UI post, @anildelphi’s dashboard RT). Infrastructure and scalability narratives also gain attention (@mert on Solana TPS). No direct pump.fun token or post-launch focus detected—clear gap for pump.studio to own.  
- **Exploitable Gaps**: Lack of discussion on post-launch token management or pump.fun ecosystem tools. Competitors appear focused on consumer UI or unrelated crypto themes. Opportunity to position pump.studio as the go-to infrastructure for pump.fun token creators post-launch with targeted content.

---

**3. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Hackathon Sentiment**: Neutral to low. No mentions of the hackathon or pump.fun in monitored tweets. Indicates either saturation or lack of interest among key players with 4 days left. Risk of fading relevance.  
- **Pump.fun Sentiment**: Neutral. No direct mentions of pump.fun platform or tokens by advisors or founders. @mert’s outreach to @nikitabier (7517V) on creator earnings shows tangential interest in token economics but no deeper engagement.  
- **Our Space (Post-Launch Tools)**: Non-existent in current discourse. No monitored accounts discussing post-launch token management or control room concepts. Opportunity to shape narrative unchallenged if we act swiftly.

---

**4. ACTIONABLE DIRECTIVES (NEXT 12-24 HOURS)**  
- **Content Push**: Publish a build-in-public update on X showcasing a specific pump.studio feature (e.g., real-time token analytics dashboard). Tag @pumpdotfun, @a1lon9, and @mert to draw attention. Focus on infrastructure value for pump.fun token creators.  
- **Engagement Spike**: Comment on @mert’s Solana perps UI post (8128V) with a constructive question or praise, linking it to pump.studio’s mission of empowering creators with post-launch tools. Drive subtle awareness without overt pitching.  
- **Advisor Outreach**: DM @anildelphi with a concise pitch on how pump.studio’s control room aligns with analytical tool interest (reference BTC dashboard RT). Request feedback or a quick call before deadline.  
- **Community Signal**: Post a poll on X asking pump.fun token creators about their biggest post-launch pain points (e.g., liquidity management, community engagement). Use results to validate pump.studio’s relevance and tag pump.fun team for visibility.  
- **Momentum Check**: Monitor @pumpdotfun and founder accounts (@a1lon9, @sapijiju, @outdoteth) for any last-minute hackathon updates or winner announcements. Set alerts for real-time response if traction shifts.

**5. ADVISOR TARGETING**  
- **Primary Target: @mert (Helius CEO)**  
  - **Activity**: Most active with 14 tweets, high engagement on UI/UX and crypto scaling (up to 8128V).  
  - **Approach**: Engage publicly on his Solana UI post with a relevant comment tying to pump.studio’s creator empowerment mission. Follow with a DM requesting quick feedback on our infra play for pump.fun tokens.  
- **Secondary Target: @anildelphi (Delphi Digital CEO)**  
  - **Activity**: Limited but impactful with 1 RT on BTC analytical dashboard (6911V).  
  - **Approach**: Direct outreach via DM with tailored pitch on pump.studio as an analytical control room for pump.fun tokens. Highlight alignment with dashboard interest and request 5-minute feedback.  
- **Tertiary Target: @pumpdotfun (Platform Account)**  
  - **Activity**: Silent in last 24 hours.  
  - **Approach**: Tag in build-in-public posts and polls to ensure visibility with pump.fun team. No direct outreach needed yet—focus on public traction.
