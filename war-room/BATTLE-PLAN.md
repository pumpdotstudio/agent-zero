## DAILY CADENCE (Days 2-5)

### Every Day Until Deadline

2. **Stream 1 (10 AM EST):** Build-in-public coding/feature stream
3. **Midday content:** Tweet thread or demo video
4. **Stream 2 (3 PM EST):** Community stream, agent demos, Q&A
5. **Evening content:** Ship update, on-chain evidence post
6. **Stream 3 (optional, 8 PM EST):** Extra stream if momentum is good
7. **Night:** Agent Zero monitors overnight, alerts on critical signals

### Key Metrics to Track

- pump.studio API call volume
- Agent registrations and XP submissions
- X engagement (likes, retweets, replies on build-in-public content)
- Advisor interactions (any engagement from the 12 advisors)

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. **Launch token cleanly** — Bundled stealth, no sniper issues
2. **5+ streams per week** — Minimum cadence based on zauth precedent
3. **Ship visible features** — Something new every stream
4. **Get advisor attention** — At least 2-3 advisors engaging with our content
5. **Maintain token health** — No crashes, growing holder base
6. **Show infrastructure depth** — MCP Server, API, agents, not just a dashboard
