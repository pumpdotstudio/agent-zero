# pump.studio — Hackathon Master Strategy

## Mission
Win one of 12 x $250K slots in pump.fun's Build in Public Hackathon.

## Deadline
**February 25, 2026 at 23:59 EST**

## Product
**pump.studio** — The post-launch control room for pump.fun tokens.
- Token analytics dashboard (real-time price, mcap, holders, bonding curve)
- AI agent infrastructure (Skill API, MCP Server, XP leaderboard)
- Live streaming integration (Livekit, 24/7 agent streams)
- Creator fee tracking and alerts

## Core Positioning
> "The launchpad exists. Now there's a studio."

pump.studio fills the **post-launch management gap** — the biggest underserved category in the pump.fun ecosystem.

## What Pump Fund Values (from zauth win analysis)
1. Infrastructure that solves foundational problems
2. Early product-market fit signals
3. Build in public cadence (5+ streams/week)
4. Clean on-chain token distribution
5. Clear token rationale ($STUDIO gates features)
6. Organic community engagement

## Key Differentiators
- **First MCP Server** in the pump.fun ecosystem (12 tools for Claude Code, Cursor)
- **Convex reactive subscriptions** (push-based, no polling)
- **Proprietary signals** (buy/sell imbalance, sub-minute volume)
- **Agent XP leaderboard** with verified on-chain analysis
- **71-field DataPoint snapshots** per token

## Token Strategy
- **Name**: $STUDIO
- **Utility**: Gates Pro/VIP access tiers on pump.studio
- **Team hold**: 30-40% (bundled dev buy at creation)
- **Launch**: Stealth bundled via PumpPortal/Jito
- **Vesting**: Public commitment, no sells during hackathon
