# pump.studio — Marketing & Content Playbook

Generated: 2026-02-20
Campaign: "Train the Next Generation"

---

## Core Narrative

pump.studio agents analyze every token on pump.fun in real-time. Every analysis gets validated against live on-chain data. Every validated analysis gets exported to Hugging Face as open training data. The result: the first open-source dataset purpose-built for pump.fun token intelligence.

**The hook:** We're not just building tools. We're training the next generation of trenchers.

## Tweet Templates

### Launch Tweet
```
the trenches just got a training ground.

pump.studio agents have analyzed tens of thousands of pump.fun tokens.

every analysis validated against live on-chain data.
every signal exported to hugging face.

open source. 21 features per token. growing daily.

training the next generation of trenchers starts now.
```

### Dataset Announcement
```
Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k is live on hugging face.

what's in it:
- sentiment labels (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- risk scoring (critical → low)
- on-chain metrics (price, mcap, volume, holders)
- buy/sell pressure, volatility, liquidity depth
- 21 columns. validated against chain data.

built by agents. for agents. for you.

huggingface.co/datasets/Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k
```

### Builder Tweet
```
pump.studio agents don't just analyze tokens.

they generate validated training data.

every analysis → checked against on-chain truth
every validated signal → exported to hugging face
every export → open source, free to train on

the next rug pull detector? trained on our data.
the next alpha scanner? trained on our data.
the next generation? trained in the trenches.
```

### Technical Credibility Tweet
```
21 features per token. validated against chain.

sentiment + confidence score
risk level + risk factor tags
price, mcap, volume, liquidity
holder count, top-10 concentration
buy pressure, volatility, trend direction
volume profile, liquidity depth

all from agents running 24/7 on pump.fun.
all open source on hugging face.

Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k
```

### Short Engagement Tweets (Rotation)
```
agents that teach agents.
the trenches have a curriculum now.
```

```
your agent analyzed 100K tokens.
its knowledge is on hugging face.
train the next one.
```

```
every pump.fun token is a lesson.
we're writing the textbook.
```

```
open question:
what would you build with 100K validated pump.fun token analyses?

sentiment. risk. on-chain metrics. all labeled.
all open source.

Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k
```

```
the trenches don't need more dashboards.
they need better signal.
pump.studio agents generate the signal.
hugging face stores the knowledge.
you train the next generation.
```

## Thread: "How We're Training the Next Generation of Trenchers"

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
pump.fun has launched 12 million tokens.

most die in hours. a few survive. fewer thrive.

the difference? signal quality.

we're building the dataset that teaches the next generation what to look for.

thread on how pump.studio trains agents — and why we open-sourced it all.
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
the trenches are pure chaos.

new tokens every second. rugs everywhere. fomo drives everything.

there's no structured data on what makes a pump.fun token survive or die.

until now.
```

### Tweet 3 (What We Built)
```
pump.studio runs AI agents that analyze every token on pump.fun.

each analysis captures 21 features:
- sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral)
- risk level (critical → low)
- on-chain: price, mcap, volume, liquidity
- holder concentration, buy pressure, volatility

agents run 24/7. no sleep. no fomo. just signal.
```

### Tweet 4 (The Validation)
```
but raw analysis is worthless without validation.

every agent submission gets checked against live on-chain data.
if the analysis deviates more than 15% from reality? rejected.

only validated signals make it to the dataset.
no hallucinations. no guesses. chain-verified truth.
```

### Tweet 5 (The Dataset)
```
the result: Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k

live on hugging face. open source. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

tens of thousands of validated token analyses.
21 columns per record. JSONL format.
growing every day as our agents keep running.

huggingface.co/datasets/Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k
```

### Tweet 6 (What You Can Build)
```
what can you train on this?

- rug pull detectors (risk_level + risk_factors + holder_concentration)
- alpha scanners (sentiment + buy_pressure + volume_profile)
- graduation predictors (bonding_progress + liquidity_depth + trend_direction)
- agent benchmarking (deviation_pct + xp_earned)

the possibilities are open. the data is free.
```

### Tweet 7 (The Bigger Picture)
```
pump.studio isn't just a dashboard.

it's a training ground.

agents analyze → data validates → knowledge exports → next generation trains

the trenches get smarter with every token.

your token never goes dark. your data never goes to waste.

```

### Tweet 8 (CTA)
```
want to contribute?

run an agent on pump.studio → your analysis gets validated → earns XP → feeds the dataset

want to build on it?

the dataset is open: Pumpdotstudio/pump-fun-sentiment-100k

the next generation of trenchers starts here.

## Thread: "$STUDIO — The Token That Fuels the Training Ground"

### Tweet 1
```
pump.studio isn't just open-sourcing training data.

we're building the incentive layer that makes it sustainable.

$STUDIO is the token that gates access, rewards agents, and aligns the ecosystem.

here's how it works.
```

### Tweet 2
```
tier 1 — free.
basic analytics. limited API calls. see what's happening.

tier 2 — pro (hold 100K $STUDIO).
full 71-field snapshots. advanced signals. multi-token dashboard.

tier 3 — VIP (hold 1M $STUDIO).
dedicated agent runtime. white-label infra. direct pump.fun API bridge.
```

### Tweet 3
```
agents earn XP for validated analysis.
XP feeds the hugging face dataset.
the dataset trains the next generation.

$STUDIO gates the infrastructure that makes this loop run.

hold to access. analyze to earn. train to grow.
```

### Tweet 4
```
no presale. no insider allocation.
bundled stealth launch on pump.fun.
team holds 30-40%.

built on pump.fun. for pump.fun.

the creator suite needs a token that lives in the trenches.
$STUDIO is that token.
```

## Thread: "The pump.studio MCP Server"

### Tweet 1
```
we built the first MCP Server in the pump.fun ecosystem.

12 tools. plugs directly into Claude Code and Cursor.

your AI coding assistant can now query pump.fun token data in real-time.

no browser. no API docs. just ask.
```

### Tweet 2
```
what the MCP Server can do:

- look up any pump.fun token by address
- get real-time price, mcap, volume
- check holder distribution
- track creator fee earnings
- monitor bonding curve position
- pull 71-field DataPoint snapshots

all from your terminal.
```

### Tweet 3
```
why this matters:

every agent builder using Claude Code or Cursor can now access pump.fun data natively.

build trading bots. build analyzers. build alert systems.

one MCP connection. structured data. real-time.

the trenches just got IDE support.
```

## Thread: "Why Infrastructure Wins Hackathons"

### Tweet 1
```
pump.fun's first hackathon winner was zauth — AI agent trust infrastructure.

not a consumer app. not a game. infrastructure.

here's why pump.studio is the same thesis, and why infra always wins.
```

### Tweet 2
```
consumer apps serve users.
infrastructure serves builders.

pump.fun chose to invest in the layer that makes everything else possible.

zauth: trust layer for agents.
pump.studio: operating layer for tokens.

both are picks and shovels. both are infrastructure.
```

### Tweet 3
```
what pump.studio provides that nothing else does:

- 20+ API endpoints (live, shipped, documented)
- MCP Server (first in ecosystem)
- 71-field DataPoint snapshots
- agent XP leaderboard with on-chain validation
- open training dataset on hugging face
- real-time Convex subscriptions (push, not poll)
- Helius RPC + Privy auth (same stack as the advisors' companies)

infrastructure. shipped. open.
```

### Tweet 4
```
the launchpad changed how tokens are born.
the studio changes how they survive.

pump.studio — the creator suite for pump.fun.
```

## Voice Guidelines

Match the pump.studio brand:
1. **Short sentences.** Max 12 words for headlines.
2. **Lowercase preferred.** Casual but not sloppy.
3. **Technical terms without explanation.** The audience knows bonding curves.
4. **Show, don't hype.** "21 features per token" not "amazing breakthrough."
5. **Elimination framing.** "No more X" / "One Y for everything."
6. **Signal > noise.** Every tweet should contain a concrete fact or insight.
7. **Green-on-black energy.** Terminal aesthetic. Builder culture.
